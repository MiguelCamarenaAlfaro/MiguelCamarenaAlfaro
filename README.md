## INTRODUCTION

I am currently a cybersecurity student at Waldorf University, on track to graduate in 2025 with a Bachelor's Degree in Cybersecurity and Information Technology. Over the past few years, I’ve gained hands-on experience in IT and cybersecurity through both academic projects and professional roles. Notably, I implemented an Active Directory environment in Microsoft Azure, configuring virtual machines, automating account provisioning with PowerShell scripts, and optimizing DNS configurations to ensure seamless communication across systems.

Professionally, I’ve worked as an IT Support Technician at Log(N) Pacific, where I built and maintained secure infrastructures, and as a Help Desk Analyst at Verizon Wireless, where I honed my troubleshooting skills and provided advanced support for complex IT systems. My certifications, including the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate and CompTIA Security+, further reflect my commitment to excellence in this field.

I thrive on solving challenges, continuously learning, and applying my skills to make meaningful contributions in cybersecurity. I’m excited to bring my technical expertise, problem-solving abilities, and dedication to advancing digital security to any role I take on.

## OBJECTIVE

With a strong foundation in customer care, IT, and cybersecurity, I am passionate about transitioning into a role in the cybersecurity field. My hands-on experience with Active Directory, virtual machine configurations, and certifications like the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate and CompTIA Security+ have prepared me for success. I am seeking a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst Level 1 role or a position in IT where I can apply my skills to enhance digital security.
